# About This Repository

This repository contains a simple tic-tac-toe game where there are some considerations -

1.  The game will be a Player vs Computer Game
2.  There will be no AI the computer will randomly take blocks and place his turn
3.  The player will be the first to start the game

So there is no complex AI works, but still making everything in vanilla is a little bit complex. I am writing a blog about it, you will find the blog [here](https://www.mydevdiary.ml/tic-tac-toe-in-html-css-and-js/)
